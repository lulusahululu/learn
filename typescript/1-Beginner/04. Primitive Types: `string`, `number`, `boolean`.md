In **TypeScript**, primitive types are the most basic types available. Here are the key primitive types you mentioned:

---

### ✅ `string`
Represents textual data (sequences of characters).

```ts
let name: string = "John";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

---

### ✅ `number`
Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

```ts
let age: number = 25;
let pi: number = 3.14;
```

---

### ✅ `boolean`
Represents a logical value: either `true` or `false`.

```ts
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
let hasAccess: boolean = false;
```

---

### Bonus Tip: Type Inference
You don’t always need to explicitly type primitives—TypeScript can infer them:

```ts
let username = "Alice";     // inferred as string
let score = 100;            // inferred as number
let isAdmin = false;        // inferred as boolean
```

Want me to also cover other primitive types like `bigint`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`?
