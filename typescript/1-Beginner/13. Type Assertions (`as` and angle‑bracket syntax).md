In TypeScript, **type assertions** are a way to tell the compiler what type a value should be treated as. It's a way of telling TypeScript: "Trust me, I know what I'm doing." There are **two syntaxes** for type assertions:

---

### 1. **`as` syntax (Recommended)**

```ts
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

- This is the modern and recommended syntax.
- Preferred especially when working with JSX (React), where angle-brackets can conflict with JSX syntax.

---

### 2. **Angle-bracket syntax (Old style)**

```ts
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
```

- Functionally identical to the `as` syntax.
- Not recommended when using JSX, as it can cause ambiguity with HTML-like tags.

---

### When to Use Type Assertions

Use them when:
- You're confident about a variable's type but TypeScript can't infer it.
- You're working with `any`, `unknown`, or DOM elements.

Example:

```ts
const input = document.querySelector('input') as HTMLInputElement;
console.log(input.value);
```

### ⚠️ Type Assertions Do Not Perform Type Checking
TypeScript does not change the runtime behavior or perform any kind of runtime checks with assertions. So make sure your assertion is actually valid, or you might get runtime errors.
