In TypeScript, **arrays** and **tuples** are used to store collections of values, but they differ in how they define and enforce types.

---

## ✅ Arrays

Arrays in TypeScript work like JavaScript arrays but with **type safety**.

### Syntax:
```ts
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob"];
```

You can also use generics:
```ts
let flags: Array<boolean> = [true, false];
```

### Mixed Types (less common, but possible):
```ts
let mixed: (string | number)[] = ["Alice", 42];
```

---

## ✅ Tuples

Tuples are **fixed-length** arrays where **each element can have a different type**. TypeScript uses them when you know **exactly how many elements** there are and what type each should be.

### Syntax:
```ts
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

Each index has a specific type:
```ts
console.log(person[0].toUpperCase()); // valid
console.log(person[1].toFixed(2));    // valid
```

You’ll get an error if you mix up types or lengths:
```ts
let wrong: [string, number] = [30, "Alice"]; // ❌ Error
let tooLong: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30, true]; // ❌ Error
```

## ✨ Tuple Labels (for readability)
You can label tuple elements for clarity:
```ts
let user: [name: string, age: number] = ["Bob", 25];
```

## ⛔ Key Differences

| Feature         | Array                      | Tuple                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Length         | Variable                   | Fixed                                  |
| Element Types  | Usually same               | Can differ per element                 |
| Use Case       | List of similar items      | Struct-like grouping (e.g., key-value) |
