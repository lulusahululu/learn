Enums in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants, making your code more readable and intent more clear. TypeScript provides two main types of enums: **numeric enums** and **string enums**.

---

### ‚úÖ Numeric Enums (default)

```ts
enum Direction {
  North,   // 0
  East,    // 1
  South,   // 2
  West     // 3
}

let dir: Direction = Direction.North;
console.log(dir); // 0
```

You can also assign custom numeric values:

```ts
enum StatusCode {
  OK = 200,
  BadRequest = 400,
  Unauthorized = 401
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ String Enums

```ts
enum Direction {
  North = "NORTH",
  East = "EAST",
  South = "SOUTH",
  West = "WEST"
}
```

These are more readable in logs and debugging.

---

### ‚úÖ Heterogeneous Enums (not recommended unless necessary)

```ts
enum Mixed {
  No = 0,
  Yes = "YES"
}
```

These are possible, but often better to avoid because they mix types.

---

### ‚úÖ Usage Example

```ts
enum UserRole {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST"
}

function getPermissions(role: UserRole) {
  if (role === UserRole.Admin) {
    return ['read', 'write', 'delete'];
  }
  return ['read'];
}
```

---

### üîÑ Reverse Mapping (only for numeric enums)

```ts
enum Direction {
  North = 1,
  South
}

console.log(Direction[1]); // "North"
console.log(Direction["North"]); // 1
```

---

### üìù Best Practices

- Prefer **string enums** for better readability and debugging.
- Use `const enum` if you want enums to be inlined at compile time for performance.

```ts
const enum LogLevel {
  Info = "INFO",
  Warn = "WARN",
  Error = "ERROR"
}

const level = LogLevel.Warn;
```

Sure! Here's a comprehensive `StatusCode` enum in TypeScript that includes all commonly used HTTP status codes, grouped by category (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx):

```ts
export enum StatusCode {
  // 1xx Informational
  Continue = 100,
  SwitchingProtocols = 101,
  Processing = 102,
  EarlyHints = 103,

  // 2xx Success
  OK = 200,
  Created = 201,
  Accepted = 202,
  NonAuthoritativeInformation = 203,
  NoContent = 204,
  ResetContent = 205,
  PartialContent = 206,
  MultiStatus = 207,
  AlreadyReported = 208,
  IMUsed = 226,

  // 3xx Redirection
  MultipleChoices = 300,
  MovedPermanently = 301,
  Found = 302,
  SeeOther = 303,
  NotModified = 304,
  UseProxy = 305,
  TemporaryRedirect = 307,
  PermanentRedirect = 308,

  // 4xx Client Errors
  BadRequest = 400,
  Unauthorized = 401,
  PaymentRequired = 402,
  Forbidden = 403,
  NotFound = 404,
  MethodNotAllowed = 405,
  NotAcceptable = 406,
  ProxyAuthenticationRequired = 407,
  RequestTimeout = 408,
  Conflict = 409,
  Gone = 410,
  LengthRequired = 411,
  PreconditionFailed = 412,
  PayloadTooLarge = 413,
  URITooLong = 414,
  UnsupportedMediaType = 415,
  RangeNotSatisfiable = 416,
  ExpectationFailed = 417,
  ImATeapot = 418,
  MisdirectedRequest = 421,
  UnprocessableEntity = 422,
  Locked = 423,
  FailedDependency = 424,
  TooEarly = 425,
  UpgradeRequired = 426,
  PreconditionRequired = 428,
  TooManyRequests = 429,
  RequestHeaderFieldsTooLarge = 431,
  UnavailableForLegalReasons = 451,

  // 5xx Server Errors
  InternalServerError = 500,
  NotImplemented = 501,
  BadGateway = 502,
  ServiceUnavailable = 503,
  GatewayTimeout = 504,
  HTTPVersionNotSupported = 505,
  VariantAlsoNegotiates = 506,
  InsufficientStorage = 507,
  LoopDetected = 508,
  NotExtended = 510,
  NetworkAuthenticationRequired = 511
}
```

You can now use `StatusCode.OK`, `StatusCode.NotFound`, etc., in your code for better readability and type safety.

Let me know if you'd like a version with descriptions or helper functions like `isSuccess(code: StatusCode)` or similar!
