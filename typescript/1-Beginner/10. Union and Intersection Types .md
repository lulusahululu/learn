**Union** and **Intersection** types are powerful features in TypeScript that help you work with types more flexibly and safely.

---

### 🔀 Union Types (`|`)

A **Union Type** allows a variable to be **one of several types**.

#### ✅ Syntax:
```ts
let value: string | number;
```

Here, `value` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

#### 🔍 Example:
```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}

printId(101);      // OK
printId("abc123"); // OK
```

> Useful when a value could be of **multiple different types**.

---

### 🔗 Intersection Types (`&`)

An **Intersection Type** combines multiple types into **one**. The resulting type must satisfy **all** of the types.

#### ✅ Syntax:
```ts
type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };

type Person = A & B;
```

Now `Person` must have both `name` and `age`.

#### 🔍 Example:
```ts
const person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};
```

> Useful when you want to **merge multiple type definitions**.

|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Combines      | Types that could be one or the other| Types that must include all fields/members |
| Think of it as| **OR**                              | **AND**                                    |
