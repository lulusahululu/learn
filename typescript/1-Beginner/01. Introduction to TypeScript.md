## üß† What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing** and powerful features to help you write safer, more maintainable code.

It was developed by Microsoft and compiles down to regular JavaScript, so it works anywhere JavaScript works (browsers, Node.js, etc.).

## ‚úÖ Why Use TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catches type-related bugs during development.
- **Better Tooling**: Enhanced code completion, refactoring, and documentation with IDEs like VSCode.
- **Improved Readability**: Easier to understand what a variable or function is supposed to do.
- **Scalability**: Great for large codebases or teams.

## üî§ Basic Example

### JavaScript
```js
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

### TypeScript
```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

Here, TypeScript enforces that `name` must be a string, and the function will return a string.

## üß© Key Features

- **Static Types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Type Inference**: Types guessed automatically if not provided.
- **Interfaces & Types**: Define custom types for objects and functions.
- **Generics**: Make code reusable for any data type.
- **Enums**: Define named constant values.
- **Decorators** (advanced): For meta-programming.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use TypeScript

1. **Install TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

2. **Create a `.ts` file**:
   ```ts
   let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
   console.log(message);
   ```

3. **Compile to JavaScript**:
   ```bash
   tsc file.ts
   ```
