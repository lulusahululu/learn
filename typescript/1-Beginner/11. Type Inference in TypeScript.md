**Type Inference** in TypeScript is the ability of the TypeScript compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable, parameter, or return value when it is not explicitly specified. It makes TypeScript more flexible and easier to write while still benefiting from type safety.

### üîç Basic Examples

#### 1. **Variable Declaration**
```ts
let message = "Hello"; // inferred as string
let count = 10;         // inferred as number
let isDone = true;      // inferred as boolean
```

#### 2. **Function Return Type**
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b; // return type inferred as number
}
```

### üß† Where Inference Happens

#### 3. **Array Inference**
```ts
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // inferred as number[]
let mixed = [1, "hello", true]; // inferred as (number | string | boolean)[]
```

#### 4. **Object Inference**
```ts
let user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
}; 
// inferred as { name: string; age: number }
```

#### 5. **Contextual Typing**
Used when the type is inferred from the context:
```ts
window.onmousedown = function (event) {
  console.log(event.button); // event is inferred as MouseEvent
};
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Let TypeScript infer types when it's obvious.
- Use explicit types when:
  - You want better readability or documentation.
  - The type is complex or union-based.
  - You're working with public APIs or libraries.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Type inference is limited and sometimes can be too generic (e.g., `any`).
- TypeScript may infer broader types than desired if there's not enough context.
